# There is no answer

Often times i sit, my stomach churning and my heart beating.
Afraid.
Guilty.
In pain.

And i think, why am i this way. What is the reason i feel this way. Am i hurt?
by something someone said, am i afraid of a consequence yet to materialize,
or am i simply sad, upset at the way i am and the way i will be.

It's hard i find, to untangle the feelings. Thoughts bubble to the top bursting
with explanations. Maybe i'm mad at myself, disappointed at who i am. Perhaps
i am afraid of the things people will do to me because i am different. Maybe i
blame myself for the pain of others, for i was not able to help. Or maybe simply
i yearn for the love of someone who feels as if they will never know how to give
it.

Perhaps i am lonely, the pain of not being understood, or worse,
mindfully misunderstood, catching up with me.

The hard thing here is that unlike a problem in the world. The real physical
world. There is perhaps no answer.

Not in the sense that i don't have enough information to conclude, enough
insight, enough wisdom. Not in the sense that there no exact answer but rather
a probability of each, not in the sense that all of these reasons are true in
one way or another.

There. is. no. answer.

# Failure

When i started to realize my anxiety was a problem i treated it as such. Every
breakdown an opportunity to evaluate, to think, to conclude and to change.

Every thought something to tackle. Every moment a opportunity to be aware, to
reframe, every situation one to face, one to beat.

It took me a long time to realize. I had made just existing a failure on my
shoulders.

Every situation became laced with blame. What did i do wrong to feel bad. Why
did i deserve this. What did i have to learn from it. What could i be spending
every second doing that i wasn't?

This guilt of existing came so naturally to me. It felt familiar, comforting
almost. But with this came a feeling of failure. A ever lasting, ever present
feeling.

For never was there a day where i did enough. Was enough. Thought enough.

Everyday i disappointed. Everyday i fought.

# Home

A funny thing about human brains is their unshakable attraction towards comfort.
But comfort is not always good. Sometimes it's remaining somewhere where you
know you are unhappy. Sometimes it's laying in bed when you planned to go to the
gym. Often it's walking the same path in your mind, even when you know it ends
at a trap.

Changing the way you think is a interesting challenge. In every moment you can
choose to think differently. To practice letting go, to sit with your emotions
and let them pass.

I learnt how to do this rather quickly.

The thing i did not anticipate, was the allure of the old paths.
I _Wanted_ to think, to ruminate. I wanted to find reasons to blame myself for
every situation, to think about every way the future would go wrong and how much
i hated myself for it.

I knew thinking about these things would make me sad. I knew it wouldn't help,
i knew that these things were mostly patterns of thoughts i had proven to be
untrue.

And yet i kept coming back. As if they were home. A home full of pain and
grief and guilt but home nonetheless.

When left with the simple task of _waiting_ i found myself twitchy, aching
to run home. Knowing the outcome but wanting to go anyway.

How would one solve such a problem in the real world? A damsel in distress
running towards a burning building with nobody in it. A thirsty man walking
towards the desert.

There. Is. No. Answer.

# Being a human.

Being a human is to be a walking paradox. To want the things that hurt you and
to run from the things that help.

The thought that maybe this time i can figure out why everything feels so
overwhelming is a feeling i will always have. Like a engineering trying the
same problem over and over again expecting a different answer.
