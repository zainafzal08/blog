There's a thing about worries,<br>
The big ones that take years to arrive<br>
The small ones that come in each moment<br>
The ones that are desperate pleas of "not again"<br>
And the ones that are silent prayers for "not ever".

Each one requires something,<br>
Something to be given<br>
Often taken<br>
Something we seldom acknowledge we have<br>
Until it's all gone.

But in the moments we give or let be taken<br>
We can instead hope.<br>
For big things that may never come<br>
For small things that always come<br>
A gentle want for "again"<br>
A loud proclamation of "at least once".

And suddenly you may find<br>
That something is refilled.<br>
Indescribable, unmeasurable<br>
infinite somedays and scarce others

Whatever it is. It feels good<br>
And I could use a little more
